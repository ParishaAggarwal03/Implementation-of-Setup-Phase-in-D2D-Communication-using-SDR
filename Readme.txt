Implementation of Setup Phase of D2D Communication using SDR

There are numerous files but only two files are main which are needed to be run on different devices while the other files are to support the various functions written in the main files. The main files contain the sending and receiving of various signals or frames arranged in proper order and iterations as needed. 

Before running the files, make sure that the required tool packages and hardware support is installed in matlab.

The following steps are to followed:

1. Use two different PCs and copy all the files to same locations on respective PCs.
2. Open the Device 1 file one PC and Device 2 file on another PC.
3. The files should be run at same time to have proper synchronization of sending and receiving of signals.

The output shall be printed in script window in case of Device 1 while in terminal window in care of Device 2.

For using one more device we need to copy the code of Device 2 and the respective delays in it to time the sending and receiving process properly.
